This Car Price Prediction system is a comprehensive machine learning project that accurately estimates vehicle prices using advanced regression techniques. The application analyzes multiple vehicle attributes including horsepower, torque, make, body size, drivetrain, and engine specifications to generate predictions. Through systematic evaluation of 10 different algorithms—ranging from linear models to ensemble methods—XGBoost emerged as the optimal choice, achieving an impressive R² score of 0.9525 with minimal error metrics (MAE and RMSE). The model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application with a clean, user-friendly interface that enables real-time price predictions based on user-selected vehicle configurations.
